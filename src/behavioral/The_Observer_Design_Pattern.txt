The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. In this pattern, when one object (called the subject) changes its state, all of its dependents (called observers) are notified and updated automatically. The Observer pattern promotes loose coupling between objects, which allows for flexibility and extensibility in object-oriented software.
