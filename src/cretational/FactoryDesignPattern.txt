The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interfacefor creating objectsin a superclass,
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

In other words, the Factory Design Pattern defines an abstract factory interface that specifies the methods for creating objects, 
but the actual creation of objects is delegated to the concrete subclasses. 
This allows for flexible object creation without requiring the client code to be aware of the specific types of objects being created.

The pattern is useful when the client code doesn't know in advance what specific object types it will need to create,
or when it wants to delegate the responsibility of object creation to another class.making it easier to maintain and modify in the future.
